# ScrapBook
A site for you to journal and record all your favorite moments from your favorite getaways.

Let's say you have a trip planned to go to Spain with your four best friends. With ScrapBook, you can start a journal for that trip and then add photos and various other trip details. Save your trips and go back and enjoy the memories for years to come!

## Product Summary
ScrapBook is a journal, scrapbook and travel blog all in one. No more messy books that fall apart over time, and ScrapBook is more focused for this specific need than a social media site, so your memories aren't cluttered with other noise like politics or bad dad jokes!

## A word from our founder, Brian Huston
"I love to travel, and being that I love to travel so often, I want all my memories in one place, where I can easily pull them up and enjoy them. ScrapBook gives you the ability to store critical information like what airline you flew and how much it cost. Also, what restaurants, bars, museums, etc.. you visited and loved. ScrapBook is an elegant and easy-to-use approach to journaling about your favorite adventures."

## Getting Started
Getting started with ScrapBook is simple. Just enter a name for your trip and whatever info you want to start your trip off with. Begin a trip with dates of travel, airline info, photos, even hotels you've booked. ScrapBook is a snap when it comes to set up and you can always add information later!

## Customer Review
"I've always loved to travel and when I do, I of course take tons of pictures and journal whatever I can. I recently discovered ScrapBook while poking around online, which was just in time for my trip to Costa Rica with my wife and our kids. I set up a journal entry with ScrapBook - it took less than a minute to do - and I can't be happier with the results. All my photos are in one spot, accompanied appropriately by the correct photos. I have all kinds of awesome information easily categorized so I can build on this adventure next time I come to Costa Rica. I can't wait to use ScrapBook again for that trip or whatever else comes next!"
